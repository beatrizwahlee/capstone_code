Additional Comments:
Issues to be handled for the next version:
----------------------------------------
PROBLEM 1:
46,065 users (2.06%) have empty histories: These users are in the validation/test set and need special handling
 - Filters them out during train/test split
 - Provides popularity-based fallback for cold start cases
 - Skips test samples with no positive labels
----------------------------------------
PROBLEM 2:
Severe category imbalance (ratio: 32,020): This is actually showing the extreme imbalance between the most and least frequent categories (sports has 32,020 articles vs. some categories with just 1-2 articles)
 - No code change needed - this is expected and validates your project!
 - Document it as motivation for diversity-aware re-ranking
 - Your Phase 2 diversity algorithms will address this
